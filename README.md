# domcat
Hello, I'm domcat, a super cool, lightweight & simple WordPress starter theme for developpers

## How am I ?
Hello developer ! I'm a WordPress starter theme, I'm not all naked and actualy the webpage you are in is me ! I'm very minimal & easy to understand, I use modern workflow like gulp, sass, and love. I'm not meant for being used as a parent theme, just adopt me and hack me ! [Check my website](http://www.domcat.com/ "domcat") to see how I look without modification.

## Requirements
- A working WordPress installation
- Npm (packaged in node)

## How to use me ?
Go to your wordpress theme folder with your terminal, and type the following commands :
Yo, be sure you are using the version 6 on node as there's a bunch of stuff not working with the latest.
than type this:

	$ npm install
	$ gulp

You are now ready for happy coding !

## Gulp tasks
I have some embeded gulp tasks that can be use for you workflow :

- `gulp` : Watch the `scss` directory and compile files to the style.css file
- `gulp styles` : Just compile the scss (no watching)
- `gulp minify` : Minify the style.css file, do this before production
- `gulp images` : Compress images located in the images folder
- `gulp compress` : Minify the javascript
